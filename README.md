*This project is in its early stages, so the following outlines our goals.*

# shrikenet

**shrikenet** is online community software for small organizations like
schools, churches, clubs, and sports teams. It's designed so that (1)
organizations can interact directly with their members; and (2) members can
interact safely, without pressure, at times of their own choosing.

## Organization Owned

    organization <--> member

**shrikenet** is an *organization owned network*. And yes, it's designed to
be an alternative to *vendor owned networks* like Facebook and Twitter. By
definition, vendor owned networks force organizations and their members to
interact with one another via a middleman, the vendor.

    organization <--> vendor <--> member

This vendor middleman model has several problems:

- inappropriate content;
- invasive advertising;
- unsafe discourse (bullying, scams, predators, etc.);
- [deplatforming][6] (censorship);
- muddled flow of information (vendor optimized);
- poor organization support;
- dependence on vendor;
- vendor's rights to *organization* content; and
- vendor's collection and sales of *organization* data.

**shrikenet** doesn't have these problems.

Organizations use **shrikenet** to run their own online communities using
their own rules.

## Member Friendly

**shrikenet** is the members one stop shop to find out what's happening with
their organization. Members can check-up on their organization, at their
convenience, in a manner that suits them.

## Documentation

The project's design documentation is in the [docs][4] folder of the
repository.

## Project Name

The **shrikenet** name is inspired from a prominent character in Dan Simmons
[Hyperion Cantos][5] series of science fiction novels. The name was chosen
because it's fairly unique, it's short, and Eugene thinks the Shrike is
cool.

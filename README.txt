# Shrike Project

We're building social network software for small organizations like
schools, churches, clubs, and sports teams. It's designed to allow
organizations to **interact directly with their members** and to do so
safely.

    organization <--> member

We describe this as an *Organization Owned Social Network*. And yes, it's
designed to be a capable alternative to *Vendor Owned Social Networks*
like Facebook and Twitter. By definition, vendor owned networks force
organizations and their members to interact with one another via a middle
man, the vendor.

    member <--> vendor <--> organization

This vendor owned model has several problems:

- total dependence on vendor;
- poor organization support;
- unsafe discourse (bullying, scams, predators, etc.);
- muddled flow of information (vendor optimized);
- invasive advertising with inappropriate content;
- vendor has full access to your content;
- limited rights to your own content; and
- collection and sales of your data.

Organizations endure these problems and more because they have no
reasonable alternative. This project aims to be a great alternative.

## Documentation

repository.

## Project Name

The *Shrike* name is inspired from a prominent character in Dan Simmons
[Hyperion Cantos][5] series of science fiction novels. The name was
chosen because it's fairly unique, it's short, and Eugene thinks the
Shrike is cool.

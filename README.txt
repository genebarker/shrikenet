# shrikenet

**shrikenet** is social network software for small organizations like schools,
churches, clubs, and sports teams. It's designed to allow organizations to
**interact directly with their members** and to do so safely.

    organization <--> member

We describe this as an *Organization Owned Social Network*. And yes, it's
designed to be an alternative to *Vendor Owned Social Networks* like
Facebook and Twitter. By definition, vendor owned networks force
organizations and their members to interact with one another via a middle
man, the vendor.

    organization <--> vendor <--> member

This vendor owned / vendor centric model has several problems:

- dependence on vendor;
- poor organization support;
- unsafe discourse (bullying, scams, predators, etc.);
- muddled flow of information (vendor optimized);
- invasive advertising with inappropriate content;
- vendor's rights to *organization* content; and
- collection and sales of *organization* data.

**shrikenet** doesn't have these problems.

Organizations use **shrikenet** to run their own social networks using their
own rules.

## Project Name

because it's fairly unique, it's short, and Eugene thinks the Shrike is
cool.

![AGPL Logo][2]

This license was chosen since we wanted the proven benefits of [GNU's
Licenses][3] and this is their recommended version for server software.

## Documentation

The project's design documentation is in the [docs][4] folder of the
repository.

## Project Name

The *Shrike* name is inspired from a prominent character in Dan Simmons
[Hyperion Cantos][5] series of science fiction novels. The name was
chosen because it's fairly unique, it's short, and Eugene thinks the
Shrike is cool.

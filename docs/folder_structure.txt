# Folder Structure

Currently, the system uses [flask][1] to orchestrate web services. The
project folders are organized as that found in the flask documentation and
examples. We added three more folders to this structure:

Folder      Layer     Description
----------- --------- -----------------------------------------------------
entities    entities  app data, functions, and interface definitions
usecases    usecases  orchestrates flow of data to / from entities
                      (to perform transactions)
adapters    adapters  product, library, and storage adapters

These three folders contain the core code of the project and have no
dependencies on flask. See the [Hexagonal Architecture][2] document for
further detail on the content of these folders.

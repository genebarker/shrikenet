# Project Design Documentation

This folder contains the project's design documentation. The documentation
is written in plain text, then supplemented as-needed with pictures and
models:

Type        Format
----------- -----------------
Plain Text  .txt files
Pictures    [PNG Files][1]
Models      [StarUML][2]

## .txt File Guidelines

In general, the files should be written so that they display well using an
(80) column terminal. Accordingly:

- limit line length to (76) characters
  (so can be edited well with terminal editors with line numbering)
- optionally, markup using [Pandoc Markdown][3]
  (provides a little structure and as a bonus it renders well)

# Project Design Documentation

This folder contains the project's design documentation. The documentation
is written in plain text, then supplemented as-needed with pictures and
models:

Type        | Format
----------- | ---------------------------
Plain text  | [Markdown (CommonMark)][1]
Pictures    | [PNG Files][2]
Models      | [StarUML][3]

## Markdown Guidelines

In general, the files should be written so that they display well using an
(80) column terminal window. Accordingly:

- limit line length to (76) characters; this makes it easy to edit well on
  terminal editors with line numbering
- markup lightly using [CommonMark][1]; this provides a little structure and
  as a bonus it renders well
- use `.md` for the file extension

# Project Design Documentation

This folder contains the project's design documentation. The documentation
is written in plain text, then supplemented as-needed with pictures and
models:

Type        | Format
----------- | --------------------------------
Plain text  | [Markdown (GitHub Flavored)][1]
Pictures    | [PNG Files][2]
Models      | [StarUML][3]

## Markdown Guidelines

In general, the files should be written so that they display well using an
(80) column terminal window. Accordingly:

- think **elegant plain text** designed for the terminal
- limit line length to (76) characters; this makes it easy to edit well on
  terminal editors with line numbering
- markup lightly using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][1]; this provides a little
  structure and as a bonus it renders well with most markdown tools
- use `.md` for the file extension
